# RWC-DB-Phase-1

After roughly 6 months into my programming journey, I decided I wanted to create a project that tested me and tied alot of the skills I had learnt together. 
As my primary focus has been data analysis, I knew the project would be "Answering questions about x dataset".
However, I did not know what this dataset would be. Being an avid rugby fun... scratch that, being obsessed with rugby, I knew I wanted to work on rugby data.
Fortunately, I couldn't really find any datasets and therefore decided I wanted to create my own. This is what this project has now become all about. 
I used beautiful soup to scrape the Rugby World Cup of 1987's statistics from wikipedia, and put them in a pandas dataframe, and then ended up doing so for 
every world cup thereafter until the last edition in 2019. 

This repo includes the code that enabled me to scrape the data for each RWC as well as a csv with the complete match data across the 377 matches at the 9 Rugby World Cups. 

I call this "Phase 1", because I've realized that this project can be a whole lot more. 
To add to this matches table, I will create a table for teams, tournaments, players, and more if need be.

Therefore, the idea for Phase 2 is to build on this start and create a comprehensive database for the Rugby World Cup.
